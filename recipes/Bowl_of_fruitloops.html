        While the Tucan and bright packaging might give off the impression 
        that fruitloops are a fun treat, the reality is actually quite differennt.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a confort food, sweet cereal like fruit loops are often leaned upon 
        during periods of peak stress or emotional termoil. This means that there 
        is a direct correlation between the amount of suffering in the world and <strong>Big Loop</strong>

    <p> 
        This should scare you especially since this problem will never be solved.

        Hey, you're all worked up! You know what will make you feel better?
    </p>

    <p> 
        Thats right, Fruit Loops! I have included some instuctions below to help you get started.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>
    Getting your loop on only requires a few basic Ingredients
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fruitloops</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Sadness (optional but recommended)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instuctions</h2>

    <p>Now you have your ingredients you just need to thrown them together</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Get your pack of fruitloops and pour them into a bowl, now a large bowl is a good vibe, kinda like in forgetting sarah marshell. Now if you don't have a bowl, just open the packet right up and we can go from there.</li>
        <li>Get your Milk, and fill the bowl (or packet you sad, sad man) about 1/3</li>
        <li>You're pretty much good to go from here. If you brought the additional sadness (lets be honest you did) then chuck on some sad boy playlist and tuck in</li>
    </ol>
